        <em>
          The phrases highbrow, popular, classical, jazz music are often used in the common language to
          define a musical genre. The continuous development of the music concept, makes the boundaries
          that separate the various musical genres looser and somehow more fleeting. The contemporary
          musicians, moving steadily along these boundaries, can perform manifold artistic experiences and
          enrich their own professional skills. Concerts all over the world, cd recordings, teaching
          experience, master-Class, a broad editorial activity about the study of the double-bass and a
          wide list of important contributions, that is what make Claudio Marzolo a musician and teacher
          with a high level.

      <p>
        Graduated in Double Bass from the “L. D’Annunzio” Conservatory in Pescara, after completing his
        internship, he deepened and completed his musical and artistic training through advanced courses
        and orchestral training with renowned musicians such as Dorin Marc, Libero Lanzilotta, Victor
        Liberman, and Donato Renzetti.
      </p>

      <p>
        He has an extensive concert activity with chamber and symphonic ensembles, both in Italy and
        abroad. His versatility, experience, and artistic and musical training have allowed him to perform
        in prestigious theaters and venues in cities such as Toronto, Montreal, Windsor, Ottawa, Hamilton,
        Niagara (Canada), Barcelona, Madrid, Cordoba, the Basque Country, Berlin, Baden-Baden, Willingen,
        Stuttgart, and with internationally renowned artists including Mischa Maisky, Florian Zwiauer,
        Rocco Filippini, and the Winds of La Scala in Milan.
      </p>

      <p>
        He has formed and collaborated with various chamber music groups in the area. He holds a
        third-level master’s degree in chamber music from the “G. Braga” Conservatory in Teramo.
      </p>

      <p>
        He has participated in important theatrical festivals, collaborating with national and
        international artists such as Alda Merini, Lina Wertmüller, Susanna Rigacci, Stefano Belisari,
        Laura Escalada Piazzolla, and Horacio Ferrer.
      </p>

      <p>
        While remaining deeply connected to his classical roots, over the years, he felt the need to
        explore new languages and musical genres, developing a passion for ethnic, Latin, and jazz music.
        He honed his skills by attending various seminars, including the “International Workshop” at
        Columbia College in Chicago, directed by Maestro Bill Russo, earning a Diploma in Jazz Music and a
        second-level degree from the “L. Perosi” Conservatory in Campobasso with top marks. He has
        performed in numerous concerts, showcases, and international festivals, including the XXXI
        International Festival “Pescara Jazz 2003,” Toscana Jazz 2005, and the XXV International Festival
        “Jazz In Sardegna 2007” (Cagliari Jazz).
      </p>

      <p>
        He has conducted masterclasses and released CDs spanning from classical music to various musical
        genres. His teaching experience and passion for the instrument have led him to produce
        instructional texts on tuning and jazz pronunciation, culminating in the publication in 2019 of
        the first volumes of “Double Bass Scales” Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, and “Basic Jazz” Vol. 1 and Vol. 2,
        which form a comprehensive teaching series, along with other publications as co-author.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is currently a tenured professor of double bass at the “Lorenzo Perosi” Conservatory of Music in
        Campobasso.
      </p>

      <p>
        He performs in national and international theaters with a copy of the “Gaetano Rossi (1847)”
        expertly crafted by the Cremonese luthier Marco Nolli.
