          The phrases highbrow, popular, classical, jazz music are often used in the common language to
          define a musical genre. The continuous development of the music concept, makes the boundaries
          that separate the various musical genres looser and somehow more fleeting. The contemporary
          musicians, moving steadily along these boundaries, can perform manifold artistic experiences and
          enrich their own professional skills. Concerts all over the world, cd recordings, teaching
          experience, master-Class, a broad editorial activity about the study of the double-bass and a
          wide list of important contributions, that is what make Claudio Marzolo a musician and teacher
          with a high level.

        Graduated in Double Bass from the “L. D’Annunzio” Conservatory in Pescara, after completing his
        internship, he deepened and completed his musical and artistic training through advanced courses
        and orchestral training with renowned musicians such as Dorin Marc, Libero Lanzilotta, Victor
        Liberman, and Donato Renzetti.
      </p>

        He has an extensive concert activity with chamber and symphonic ensembles, both in Italy and
        abroad. His versatility, experience, and artistic and musical training have allowed him to perform

        Niagara (Canada), Barcelona, Madrid, Cordoba, the Basque Country, Berlin, Baden-Baden, Willingen,
        Stuttgart, and with internationally renowned artists including Mischa Maisky, Florian Zwiauer,

        explore new languages and musical genres, developing a passion for ethnic, Latin, and jazz music.
        He honed his skills by attending various seminars, including the “International Workshop” at
        Columbia College in Chicago, directed by Maestro Bill Russo, earning a Diploma in Jazz Music and a

      </p>

      <p>
        He has conducted masterclasses and released CDs spanning from classical music to various musical
        genres. His teaching experience and passion for the instrument have led him to produce
        instructional texts on tuning and jazz pronunciation, culminating in the publication in 2019 of
        the first volumes of “Double Bass Scales” Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, and “Basic Jazz” Vol. 1 and Vol. 2,
        which form a comprehensive teaching series, along with other publications as co-author.

        Campobasso.
